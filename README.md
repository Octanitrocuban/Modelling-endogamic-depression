# Modelling-endogamic-depression
In these repository, I will try to model the endogamic depression by creating a population and making it evoluate.

"Inbreeding depression is the reduced biological fitness which has the potential to result from inbreeding (the breeding of related individuals)." Wikipedia

The script are in the Codes folder.
The python script: PopulationsFunctions.py countains the function to make the simulation.
	The function insde are:
  	- SexeIndividus: Sex of the people in function of the probability to drawn a woman.
    - IndividusIni: Create the initial population with nIndividus. With proportion of women is pWomen.
